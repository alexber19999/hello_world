## About: In this lab, I explored the basics of Git and Github.

## **Downloading and Initializing a Repo:**
### First, I downloaded github desktop
### After Running it and creating a github account, I initialized a repository.

## **Committing:**
### When I modified the README file, I saved the modification(saved change is known as a
### commit). I did this by making changes to the readme file and then going to the github desktop application and on the left side, wrote a summary of my first commit and clicked "Commit to master".

## **History:**
### After that, I clicked on the history tab and looked over my history.

## **Publishing My Work:**
### I then published my repository.

## **Branching:**
### I created a new branch. Branching is essentially a way of maintaining multiple copies of
### code at the same time. In this branch, I created a new hello world c++ application.
### I then commited the changes to the new branch and published the branch.


## **Merging:**
### I then merged the new branch with the master branch. Merging allows you to take
### changes made in the other branches and merge them with the master branch. I then pushed
### the new changes to Github.


## **Collaboration:**
### Github allows you to efficiently collaborate with people. I invited someone to collaborate on my
### repository. I commited the changes made to the master branch.


## **Wrapping Up:**
### I then generated a git log called log.txt
